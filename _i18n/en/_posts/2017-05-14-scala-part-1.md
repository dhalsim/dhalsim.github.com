# Preface

Best way to learn a new language is to code it. I've found this helpful blog [The digital cat](http://blog.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2015/04/07/99-scala-problems-01-find-last-element/#.WRi34FN95E4) that has 20 scala problems and solutions (not 99 despite the title) and from what I saw, he got them from this [blog](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) and it also influenced from another list for [prolog](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems)! So I decided to look at them. But like always, I had some different methods and notes, too.

So I decided to share them here. I choose a different style here. Since it is already explained in the original blog, I just wanted to share my codes (and tests) with my comments. I want to try this style and see what happens. At the end of the file you can see my **WHAT I LEARNED?** part which you can find some interesting facts and sources about the theme.

## Tests

~~~scala
package org.onetofive

import org.scalatest._
import OneToFive._

class OneToFiveSuite extends FunSuite {
  val list = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

  test("1. get the last element of a list") {
    assert(last_procedural(list) === 5)
    assertThrows[NoSuchElementException] { last_procedural(Nil) }

    assert(last_recursive(list) === 5)
    assertThrows[NoSuchElementException] { last_recursive(Nil) }
  }

  test("2. get the second last element of a list") {
    assert(penultimate_procedural(list) === 4)
    assertThrows[NoSuchElementException] { penultimate_procedural(Nil) }

    assert(penultimate_recursive(list) === 4)
    assertThrows[NoSuchElementException] { penultimate_recursive(Nil) }

    assert(take_last_nth_procedural(list, 3) === 3)
    assertThrows[NoSuchElementException] { take_last_nth_procedural(Nil, 3) }
    assertThrows[IllegalArgumentException] { take_last_nth_procedural(list, 0) }

    assert(take_last_nth_recursive(list, 2) === 4)
    assertThrows[NoSuchElementException] { take_last_nth_recursive(Nil, 2) }
    assertThrows[IllegalArgumentException] { take_last_nth_recursive(list, 0) }
  }

  test("3. Find the Kth element of a list") {
    assert(nth_procedural(list, 2) === 2)
    assertThrows[NoSuchElementException] { nth_procedural(Nil, 2) }

    assert(nth_recursive(list, 2) === 2)
    assertThrows[NoSuchElementException] { nth_recursive(Nil, 2) }
  }

  test("4. Find the number of elements of a list") {
    assert(count_recursive(Nil) === 0)
    assert(count_with_fold(Nil) === 0)

    assert(count_recursive(list) === list.length)
    assert(count_with_fold(list) === list.length)
  }

  test("5. Reverse a list") {
    val reversed = list.reverse

    assert(reverse(list) === reversed)
    assert(reverse_recursive(list) === reversed)
    assert(reverse_tailrecursive(list) === reversed)
    assert(reverse_withfold(list) === reversed)
  }
}

##Solutions

~~~scala
package org.onetofive

import scala.annotation.tailrec

object OneToFive extends App {
  def last_procedural[A](xs: List[A]): A = xs.last

  def last_recursive[A](xs: List[A]): A = xs match {
    case x :: Nil => x
    case head :: tail => last_recursive(tail)
    case _ => throw new NoSuchElementException
  }

  def penultimate_procedural[A](xs: List[A]): A = if(xs.isEmpty) throw new NoSuchElementException else xs.init.last

  def penultimate_recursive[A](xs: List[A]): A = xs match {
    case head :: List(x) => head
    case head :: tail => penultimate_recursive(tail)
    case _ => throw new NoSuchElementException
  }

  def take_last_nth_procedural[A](xs: List[A], n: Int): A = {
    if(xs.isEmpty) throw new NoSuchElementException
    if(n < 1) throw new IllegalArgumentException

    xs.takeRight(n).head
  }

  // first I thought that is smart to take the last element as looking to (length - index)
  // but then I realized that Lists doesn't have a normal length property, it is calculated
  // again and again recursively through traversing the whole List. So just a small optimization:
  def take_last_nth_recursive[A](xs: List[A], n: Int): A = {
    val l = xs.length

    def iter[A](ys: List[A], n: Int): A = ys match {
      case _ if(n < 1) => throw new IllegalArgumentException
      case _ :: tail if(l - n != 0) => take_last_nth_recursive(tail, n)
      case head :: _ if(l - n == 0) => head
      case _ => throw new NoSuchElementException
    }

    iter(xs, n)
  }

  // even better
  def nth_procedural[A](xs: List[A], n: Int): A = xs.takeRight(xs.length - n + 1).head

  def nth_recursive[A](xs: List[A], n: Int): A = xs match {
    case _ if(n < 1) => throw new IllegalArgumentException
    case _ if(xs.length == 0) => throw new NoSuchElementException
    case head :: _ if(n == 1) => head
    case _ :: tail => nth_recursive(tail, n - 1)
  }

  // oh yay! tail recursive
  def count_recursive[A](xs: List[A]): Int = {
    @tailrec
    def iter(ys: List[A], n: Int): Int = ys match {
      case Nil => n
      case _ :: tail => iter(tail, n + 1)
    }

    iter(xs, 0)
  }

  // even better
  def count_with_fold[A](xs: List[A]): Int = xs.foldLeft(0){ (acc, _) => acc + 1 }

  // the obvious
  def reverse[A](xs: List[A]): List[A] = xs.reverse

  // not tail recursive
  def reverse_recursive[A](xs: List[A]): List[A] = xs match {
    case Nil => Nil
    case head :: tail => reverse_recursive(tail) ::: List(head)
  }

  // better
  def reverse_tailrecursive[A](xs: List[A]): List[A] = {
    @tailrec
    def iter(acc: List[A], ys: List[A]): List[A] = ys match {
      case Nil => acc
      case head :: tail => iter(head :: acc, tail)
    }

    iter(Nil, xs)
  }
  // even better
  def reverse_withfold[A](xs: List[A]): List[A] = xs.foldLeft(Nil: List[A]){ (ys, x) => x :: ys }

  /*
   WHAT I LEARNED?

   * You can check thrown exceptions in your tests with assertThrows
   * you could add a @tailrec annotation so that you can be sure that your function is optimized by compiler as a tail recursive function.
   * in Lists nearly every function's complexity except head is linear. So better think twice when you want to write your own recursive functions
   * You can use fold or take functions for your recursive needs!
