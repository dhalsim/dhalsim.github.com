## Work expreriences

`2017-2023`
**Senior Software Developer, Comtravo (Acquired by Navan, Formerly TripActions)**

I joined Comtravo as a Junior Software Engineer with six years of prior experience in C# development, driven by my desire to transition to Node.js and its fascinating ecosystem. Embracing the challenge of proving my expertise in this new tech stack, I swiftly advanced to middle and senior software engineering positions within a year.

In my early days with the backend team, my primary focus was on reporting. I started by refactoring code to enhance maintainability while addressing bugs.

My contributions extended to various data integrations for our B2B travel search and booking engine. These integrations involved fetching data from multiple sources, merging it into a standardised format, and facilitating asynchronous booking flows by leveraging AWS services, SNS/SQS events and AWS Step Functions.

Specific integrations I worked on included:

* Hotel integrations with booking.com and hrs
* Flight integrations with Sabre and Hitchhiker
* Train integrations with DB and Amadeus

I also made significant contributions to our CRM service, particularly in invoice management. Subsequently, I played a pivotal role in designing and implementing the Aggregated Invoices project, enabling customers to streamline their accounting processes. We used AWS Step Functions triggered by custom cron jobs for batch invoice generation, ensuring flexibility and resilience.

I introduced company roles for users and implemented a JWT based security mechanism for backend API endpoints. I designed a reusable library to validate API requests against defined service rules.

On the frontend, I worked on our new customer facing frontend application which is built with Angular. I migrated some of the reports to the new frontend, and wrote its UI tests using Cypress.

I spearheaded the design and development of travel policies, a highly sought-after feature by our customers. This involved creating MongoDB schemas, models, and a validation library for enforcing policies across various backend services and frontend applications. These policies allowed company admins and travel agents to set rules, such as budgeting and cabin types.

After the acquisition, we switched to the TripAction platform. I took on the challenge of integrating the British Airways NDC API, a new industry standard, by seamlessly integrating a Node.js service into an existing Java stack. Our solution involved the creation of a REST-based adapter and the use of Kafka queues to bridge the two technologies.

Furthermore, I joined the core team to integrate Auth0 into our authentication system, focusing on enhancing security, scalability, and compliance. I led the development of an SSO service for customer-managed SSO connections using the Auth0 API, integrating Java Spring Framework and managing infrastructure with Terraform.

`2013-2016`
**Software Developer, Amadeus R&D Istanbul**

Amadeus e-Power is a fully customizable, high performance, easy-to-use online booking engine (flight, hotel, car, train) by the time was used by about worldwide 1000+ booking portals. It can be served to B2B (agencies) or B2C customers, either using extensible e-Power UI engine or using e-Power web services.  

Responsibilities:

* Application configuration management for deploying on different farm machines. 
* Unit test initial setup, Test and Code Coverage Reports integration for Jenkins
* Application code security 
* Various Flight, Hotel, Payment, Webservice module features

`2012-2013`
**Software Development Specialist, Gezisitesi.com**

I was responsible of developing an online hotel and tour selling platform.

*Technologies used: ASP.NET MVC 4, WCF, NHibernate.*

`2010-2012`
**Software Development Specialist, Cronom**

I was responsible of developing of an XML based ASP.NET framework. Using the framework customers are able to create their web screens and forms, manage data, create different workflows by triggering actions on the screen, all by defining XML declarations and simple scripts. Product can be used with optional UI tool (Windows Forms) providing customers to generate screens, workflows, and data integrations using drag and drop UI or wizards to generate necessary XML definitions.

In my first year, I worked on supporting this product with fixing bugs and developing new features. 

That year I learned basic ASP.NET web development skills, and mostly back-end programming skills like maintaining and developing our in-house ORM framework, generating ASP.NET pages (including generating necessary Javascript code) and business workflows from XMLs defined.

Also worked on in-house solutions in Coca Cola İçecek, GlobalBilgi (Turkcell), Abdi İbrahim and Ulaşım A.Ş by helping customers to solve their enterprise requirements.

In my second year, I worked in support and development team on a rolling basis. In that period I worked with all parts of the product, including product design tool using Windows Forms and DexExpress libraries. During that time, my knowledge on the code base and architecture also increased and was able to work on more technical problems including concurrency issues.

On the last 4 months I did a project with the product to work with
cloud platforms and started to build a web platform for managing this cloud product. This let me to
develop my SOA knowledge using WCF technologies, and deployment libraries found on .net platform. In this development cycle I studied Test Driven Development heavily and practiced it using NUnit framework
